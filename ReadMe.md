🗂️ File Organizer (Python)

Ever downloaded 50 files and your Downloads folder turned into a disaster?  
Yeah, same here.

So I built this little script to **organize all the mess**, automatically.

💡 What It Does

You give it a folder path (like your Downloads),  
and it sorts everything into folders based on file type:

| Before |        | After |

| resume.pdf | 📁 PDF_Files/resume.pdf |
| selfie.jpg | 📁 JPG_Files/selfie.jpg |
| notes.docx | 📁 DOCX_Files/notes.docx |

No dragging, no clicking — just clean folders.

🚀 How to Use It

1. Open terminal in VS Code  
2. Run this command:
   ```bash
   python organizer.py
When it asks, paste the full folder path (like this):

C:\Users\YourName\Downloads

Boom!files organized in seconds
